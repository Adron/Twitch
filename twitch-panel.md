## Mission

I have a simple mission on this channel, which is to build and show coding for several languages stacks and applications I'm building. The languages include: [Go](https://golang.org/), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)), and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). In addition to the languages and their respective stacks I also work with several other tools and technologies frequently including [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) (and the respective [DataStax](https://www.datastax.com/) variants) along with infrastructure as code with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and sometimes a few other tools here and there.

## Intro to Coding & Databases

I also have some upcoming introductory session I'm planning. Check out this [article I wrote up on the upcoming session](https://compositecode.blog/2018/11/07/new-live-coding-streams-and-episodes/).

## Metal

I do also have a number of things where I intertwine metal into the twitch session(s). It's what fuels the code, always be ready, it'll come at ya without warning.

## Repositories

These are the projects I either am working on or working toward something for during the streams. At the beginning of each session I'll describe what I'm going to work on for that session, including the objectives for the specific session.

* [Twitz](https://github.com/Adron/twitz) - Console application for researching Twitter accounts. Written in Go using the Twitter API.
* [Colligere](https://github.com/ThrashingCode/colligere) - Console application written in Go.
* [Data Diluvium](https://github.com/ThrashingCode/datadiluvium) - API written in Go. Currently not working on it, but that'll change in the coming months.
* [InteroperabilityBlackBox](https://github.com/Adron/InteroperabilityBlackBox) - Console application written in C#.
* [terraformed-fields](https://github.com/Adron/terraformed-fields) - Terraform project where I'm putting together a number of resources in Google Cloud Platform for future projects, such as Data Diluvium and a DataStax Enterprise Cassandra Cluster.

## Session Checklist

If you're watching, and would like to take notes, observer, or otherwise get involved please do. Chat is there, as always, but you can dive into the issues on any of the repositories above, submit pull requests or whatever. If you've got an idea let me know, and I'll even work on it or have you on the stream to work on it with me. I'm open to all sorts of hacking on the code so just let me know and we'll make that happen. For each stream, these are the things I'll aim to provide for anybody watching:

1. An objectives list. Usually 2-6 things that I'm going to work toward acheiving in the session. This is usually things like [add logging](https://github.com/Adron/InteroperabilityBlackBox/issues/7), [configuration](https://github.com/Adron/InteroperabilityBlackBox/issues/9), or [add some badges](https://github.com/Adron/InteroperabilityBlackBox/issues/11).
2. A wrap up blog entry. I'm going to start (since I haven't done this for all previous sessions) doing this and posting it on [Composite Thrashing Code](https://compositecode.blog/). The post will then reference the videos I've streamed and archived on my [Thrashing Code Youtube Channel (subscribe there to get new videos when posted)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHSCXYCMOOS-VSUdRsn13GQ).
3. A basic timeline of the video. Again, something I haven't done traditionally, but have started doing. I'll provide this for each video in the description of the video where I archive it on Youtube and also on the blog entry I post of the video, which of course is over yonder on the [Thrashing Code Youtube Channel (subscribe there to get new videos when posted)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHSCXYCMOOS-VSUdRsn13GQ).

I've also started a video streaming repo of my gear, process, and related video streaming details. Check that out at [VidStreamHacking](https://github.com/Adron/VidStreamHacking).
