# Culture

This doc is basically a description of what behaviors are expected, not expected among the online streamer communities. As [Ambrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrose) wrote, "[When in Rome, do as the Romans do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_in_Rome,_do_as_the_Romans_do)". Same situation here.

More to come... TBD.

## Chat

Chat works a bunch of different ways depending on what you're watching. I won't even approach the element of the game sector, there's a whole host of garbage and trash in that scene so it'll get it's own doc if anything. I'm going to focus on a few different sections of chat below that outline what and how things happen. Specifically, the follow content about chat is related to Twitch Chat and topics.
