# Meetup Recording

**[Gear List](meetup-streaming-kit-gear.md)** for meetup streaming.

* First thing, people will mess with you stuff obliviously or not, it'll wreck the shot. So keep an eye on your gear, and watch out for people and their prying fingers!
* Even though it's a simplistic notion, remember to actually press the record button, and even make a checklist of all your gear to bring with you and to remember to leave with!
