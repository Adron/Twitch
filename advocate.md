# Market Your Stream

These are listed in an order to ensure they're effective and useful to those prospectively viewing your streams.

1. Schedule your streams ahead of time. Setup that schedule and post the events on Twitch under the _events_ section. Post them via the dashboard events listing [here](https://www.twitch.tv/adronhall/dashboard/events) and view them via the follower interface [here](https://www.twitch.tv/adronhall/events).
2. Blog it, like I attemp to here on my [Thrashing Composite Code Blog](https://compositecode.blog/).
3. **[Tweet it](https://twitter.com/)**. Follow good practice and use appropriate spaces between lines and state specific simple things, with emoji icons per line, with a link to the place the stream will occur. A reasonable example of this is the tweet under the [copy](#copy) section below. 
4. Reddit. Post in the **[WatchPeopleCode](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchPeopleCode/)** subreddit.
5. **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)**. Post in the feed. Possibly post in other locations depending on what you're connected with and to whom.
6. **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)**. Reluctantly, yes, one ought to post this on Facebook probably.
7. Got an email newsletter or something like [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)? Send out when you schedule an event and the moment you go live (maybe? depending on what your newsletter is for).
9. If you've got an active Discord, then post it there too. I use restream.io for that.
10. Use multi-stream to stream to more than a few single channgels with [restream.io](https://restream.io/).

*Other Possible Mediums (I'm still researching their efficacy)*

* https://www.watchmework.com/
* Sign up for account, possibly another avenue to stream? https://www.liveedu.tv/
* A whole string of sites and such on Product Hunt. https://www.producthunt.com/alternatives/watch-people-code ?? Seems and odd "product" category but late capitalism whatever right?  ;)
* No idea what this is, a medium or a tool? https://asciinema.org/

*Other Streaming Entities (Also still checking these out)*

* https://www.stream.me/
* https://www.liveedu.tv/about/

## <a name="copye"></a> Copy

The copy & messaging should be useful, with links, and related material when posting on these mediums. This is something that should be posted to all of the highlighted mediums above (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc) at the time the stream starts. Ideally during an intro video countdown.

For example, like this:

üìπ Starting a new coding hacking session right now.

ü§òüèª Just thrashing for a few minutes waiting for others to join.
