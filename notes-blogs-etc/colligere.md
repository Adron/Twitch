# Colligere

**Description** This will be ongoing sessions from [the series]() I've been creating already. The latest, which I'll be streaming this Friday at 3:33pm, I'll use as a *new* starting off point, so that people joining this Friday can start with the project without any previous knowledge of what I've worked on in previous sessions. This will be the *getting started* session for the Colligere project and coding that I'll be doing.

But there's more to this project. This is after all an open source, hosted via Github, welcome to newcomers, ready with getting started issues listed for anybody, to dive in and start coding on the project with me! If you're brand new to Go, done a little bit of Go coding, or just want to help out and are interested in trying out some of the issues please do. Here's a list of what I'm planning for the next few sessions.
