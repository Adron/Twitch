# Post Video Actions


# 1. Export the Stream

After a Twitch stream I always like to export the VOD (Video On Demand) backup. Setting up YouTube to auth against the Twitch account enable export to YouTube. Set it up so that the export is private, and then later one can make it public, do edits, or whatever else needs to be done. The following are settings that should be set for discovery and such for the video in YouTube:

* Description - Be sure to add time points and other useful information to help with discoverability.
* Tags - Again, for discoverability, and to make sure it doesn't show in unrelated places (such as coding isn't exactly *gaming*).
* Location - This one isn't as important as the above, but I always like my videos to show up in the Seattle and Ballard, Seattle geographic searches. I've found out who some neighbors are this way!
* Time/Date
* For Children - be sure to mark this as for or not for children. It's **NOT** a setting for if it is appropriate or not for them, it is a setting for if content is focused *TO THE CHILDREN*. In other words, is this something like a children's cartoon? If so, then mark yes, if not then clearly mark it no. This setting is hugely important but also a bit confusing at first glance.

# 2. Write up Additional Notes & Material

If notes were taken during stream, like a README.md or something else, make sure those are posted in repo or somewhere that viewers can find the material. If a repo was created, make sure the last bits of code for the day are committed and pushed to the repo.

What else would YOU want to see included with videos about coding? An additional blog entry? Repo? What else would be helpful to add value for you? Leave a PR, or just message me [@Adron](https://twitter.com/adron).
