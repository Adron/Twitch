# Post Video Actions


# 1. Export the Stream

After a Twitch stream I always like to export the VOD (Video On Demand) backup. Setting up YouTube to auth against the Twitch account enable export to YouTube. Set it up so that the export is private, and then later one can make it public, do edits, or whatever else needs to be done.

# 2. Write up Additional Notes & Material

If notes were taken during stream, like a README.md or something else, make sure those are posted in repo or somewhere that viewers can find the material. If a repo was created, make sure the last bits of code for the day are committed and pushed to the repo.

More coming TBD.
