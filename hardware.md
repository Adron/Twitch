## 2017 System 76 Leopard Workstation

Review: https://compositecode.blog/2017/01/19/buying-a-leopard/

Sadly, as of last week (cember 15th~) this machine's power supply arced out over a surge or something. A replacement power supply has arrived, which I swapped out, however now the motherboard appears to be toast also. The troubleshooting process continues, slow, steady, and unproductive so far. In the meantime it's all laptops for all the streaming.

**Specifications**

* 4.0 GHz i7-6850K (3.6 up to 4.0 GHz – 15 MB Cache – 6 Cores – 12 threads)
* High Performance Self-Contained Liquid Cooler
* 32 GB Quad Channel DDR4 at 2400MHz (2× 16 GB)
* 8 GB GTX 1080 with 2560 CUDA Cores DVI-D, HDMI, 3× Display Port
* Gigabit Ethernet
* Audio Rear: 8 channel (HDMI, S/PDIF), Mic Jack, Line In, Line Out
* Power Supply 750 W 80+ Certified
