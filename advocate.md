# Market Your Stream

These are listed in an order to ensure they're effective and useful to those prospectively viewing your streams. Items marked with a **^** are suggestions that I rank as a higher return action versus some of the others. Items marked with a **))** are items that can be done once and return over time is fairly decent.

1. **^** Schedule your streams ahead of time. Setup that schedule and post the events on Twitch under the _events_ section. Post them via the dashboard events listing [here](https://www.twitch.tv/adronhall/dashboard/events) and view them via the follower interface [here](https://www.twitch.tv/adronhall/events).
2. **^** Blog it, like I attemp to here on my [Thrashing Composite Code Blog](https://compositecode.blog/).
3. **^** **[Tweet it](https://twitter.com/)**. Follow good practice and use appropriate spaces between lines and state specific simple things, with emoji icons per line, with a link to the place the stream will occur. A reasonable example of this is the tweet under the [copy](#copy) section below. Also note the additional hashtags in option 2 in that section, which gets a tweet of a twitch stream retweeted to a larger audience.
4. Reddit. Post in the **[WatchPeopleCode](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchPeopleCode/)** subreddit.
5. **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)**. Post in the feed. Possibly post in other locations depending on what you're connected with and to whom.
6. **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)**. Reluctantly, yes, one ought to post this on Facebook probably.
7. Got an email newsletter or something like [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)? Send out when you schedule an event and the moment you go live (maybe? depending on what your newsletter is for).
9. **))** If you've got an active Discord, then post it there too. I use restream.io for that.
10. Use multi-stream to stream to more than a few single channgels with [restream.io](https://restream.io/). Don't do this however if you want to monetize any of the streams, I believe it's often against the rules.
11. **))** Get a pull request in at the [awesome-developer-streams](https://github.com/bnb/awesome-developer-streams)
12. **))** Sign up and get listed on [shipstreams](https://shipstreams.com).

*Other Possible Mediums (I'm still researching their efficacy)*

* https://www.watchmework.com/
* Sign up for account, possibly another avenue to stream? https://www.liveedu.tv/
* A whole string of sites and such on Product Hunt. https://www.producthunt.com/alternatives/watch-people-code ?? Seems and odd "product" category but late capitalism whatever right?  ;)
* No idea what this is, a medium or a tool? https://asciinema.org/

## <a name="copy"></a> Copy

The copy & messaging should be useful, with links, and related material when posting on these mediums. This is something that should be posted to all of the highlighted mediums above (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc) at the time the stream starts. Ideally during an intro video countdown.
