# Getting Started with Go

**Description:** For these sessions I'm going to start from the very beginning of the book "The Go Programming Language" and go through each chapter and section of the book, covering code an details about how to get started with Go, setup your environment, install Go, create a project, manage dependencies, and onwards. Here's a list of the different sections and the way I'll order them:

* Packages & the Go Tool
    * Import Paths
    * Package Declaration
    * Import Declarations
    * Blank Imports

    * Go Test
    * Test Functions
    * Coverage
    * Benchmark
    * Profiling

    * Setting Variables
    * Accessing Struct Field Tags
    * Method of a Type
    * Caution

Throughout these sessions I'll organize and add more material to the content then merely what's in the book. However I included the book above "The Go Programming Language" because it's a really solid book and I highly suggest picking up a copy. By doing so you can also study and follow along with these sessions with me, and you'll have full context of what I'm working through and showing.
