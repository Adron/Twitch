# New Live Coding Streams and Episodes!

I've been working away in [Valhalla]() on the next episodes of [Thrashing Code TV]() and subsequent content for upcoming [Thrashing Code Sessions]() on [Twitch]() and [Youtube](). The following I've broken into the main streams and shows that I'll be putting together over the next days, weeks, and months. If you've got any ideas, questions, 

## Colligere

Coding has been going a little slow, in light of other priorities and all, but it'll still be one of the featured projects I'll be working on. For a summary of where the project is, check out summary status post "[Colligere Status]()".

My next Thrashing Code Session will be this Friday the 9th at 3:33pm PST. I'll be working on, and getting re-synchronized to where the project is. Join in for some Go coding, ask questions, or just lurk and enjoy some data generation code and JSON wrangling! Then after this Friday, here's the next bunch of sessions I've got lined up.

## Getting Started with Go

This set of sessions, which I've detailed in "[Getting Started with Go]()", I'll be starting on DATEHERE. The next few streams I've outlined below.

## Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and Apache Cassandra

I'll be continuing the Terraform, bash, and related configuration and coding of using infrastructure as code practices to build out, maintain, and operate Apache Cassandra distributed database clusters. At some point I'll likely add Kubernetes, some additional *on the metal* cluster systems and start looking at Kubernetes Operators and how one can manage distributed systems on Kubernetes using this *on the metal* environment.

For this, I've lined up the next X sessions below.

## Getting Started with Multi-model Databases

This set of sessions I've detailed in "[Getting Started with a Multi-model Database]()", and this one I'll be starting on DATEHERE. Here's the short run down of the next several streams.

1. An introduction to a range of databases: Apache Cassandra, Postgresql and SQL Server, Neo4j, and ... in memory database. Kind of like 7 Databases in 7 Weeks but a bunch of databases in just a short session!
2. An Introduction - Apache Cassandra and what it is, how to get a minimal cluster started, options for deploying something quickly to try it out.
3. Adding to Apache Cassandra with DataStax Enterprise, gaining analytics, graph, and search. In this session I'll dive into what each of these capabilities within DataStax Enterprise give us and how the architecture all fits together.
4. Deployment of Apache Cassandra and getting a cluster built. Options around ways to effectively deploy and maintain Apache Cassandra in production.
5. Moving to DataStax Enterprise (DSE) from Apache Cassandra. Getting a DSE Cluster up and running with OpsCenter, Lifecycle Manager (LCM), and getting some queries tried out with Studio.
