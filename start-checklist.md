# Startup Checklist

This is a basic checklist of the things I go through before acutally starting any new stream.

 - [ ] Does OBS have the appropriate key setup for the stream?
 - [ ] If multiple monitors, or VM screen, are they all set to the appropriate resolution and configured appropriately with overlays and such?
 - [ ] Is the stream details updated with the show/session that is about to be streamed? ![Update Stream Information](/images/stream-information.png "Update Stream Information")
 - [ ] Is the chat window open and ready for monitoring autonomous of needing to switch into the dashboard or stream? i.e. pulled out of the dashboard or however you monitor it. ![alt text](/images/dashboard.png "Logo Title Text 1")
 - [ ] Are all webcams running and actually set in position and available for transitioning?
 - [ ] Does OBS have the appropriate *sources* setup for the appropriate *scenes* for each respective transition.
 - [ ] Mic check all the mics:
    - [ ] Rode Podcaster http://en.rode.com/microphones/podcaster
    - [ ] Rode Shotgun NTG1 http://en.rode.com/microphones/ntg-1
    - [ ] WebCam Mic(s)
 - [ ] Sound check setup appropriately for the OS (ala MacOS and it's odd need for [this](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/os-x-capture-audio-with-ishowu-audio-capture.505/))
- [ ] Are all files, media files, and related collateral ready for transitions?
- [ ] Any other sccripts, checklists, or other items available within easy reach?
