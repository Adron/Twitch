# Discord

Discord is another way made popular by the gaming community that is generally done off stream in the Discord App (or online on the Discord site). Here the community around a channel, topic channel, or otherwise can break out into direct messages, generally be a little saltier, and have extended conversations regardless of whether the stream is live or not.
