# Startup Checklist

This is a basic checklist of the things I go through before acutally starting any new stream.

 - [ ] Verify that OBS has the appropriate key setup for the stream.
 - [ ] Are all monitors set to the appropriate resolution.
 - [ ] Does OBS have the appropriate *sources* setup for the appropriate *scenes* for each respective transition.
 - [ ] Mic check all the mics:

    - [ ] Rode Shotgun NTG1 http://en.rode.com/microphones/ntg-1
