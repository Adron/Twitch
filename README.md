This is a repo of notes and related things per my Twitch streaming. I'll keep an index of the particular files listed here in this README.md.

* [Startup Checklist](start-checklist.md) - The checklist I go through as part of the routine for kick starting the stream.
* [Recording Gear / Hardware](hardware.md) - Gear I specifically use for my stream.
* [Advocate](advocate.md) - Where to tell people about what you're coding on your stream.
* [Gotchas](gotchas.md) - Things that don't always make sense, that cause problems, and just we need to be aware of when streaming via various operating systems. So far I've started this list covering some MacOS and Windows gotachase, and adding Linux gotchas as they appear.

## Scheduling

My current schedule is listed on my Twitch account under [events](https://www.twitch.tv/adronhall/events).
