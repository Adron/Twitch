# Startup Checklist

This is a basic checklist of the things I go through before acutally starting any new stream.

 - [ ] Does OBS have the appropriate key setup for the stream?
 - [ ] If multiple monitors, or VM screen, are they all set to the appropriate resolution and configured appropriately with overlays and such?
 - [ ] Is the stream details updated with the show/session that is about to be streamed? Check out this [video](https://youtu.be/SVvSwFz2dok) for more details.
 - [ ] Is the chat window open and ready for monitoring autonomous of needing to switch into the dashboard or stream? i.e. pulled out of the dashboard or however you monitor it.
 - [ ] Are all webcams running and actually set in position and available for transitioning?
 - [ ] Does OBS have the appropriate *sources* setup for the appropriate *scenes* for each respective transition.
 - [ ] Mic check all the mics: 
    - [ ] Rode Podcaster http://en.rode.com/microphones/podcaster
    - [ ] Rode Shotgun NTG1 http://en.rode.com/microphones/ntg-1
    - [ ] WebCam Mic(s)
 - [ ] Sound check setup appropriately for the OS (ala MacOS and it's odd need for [this](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/os-x-capture-audio-with-ishowu-audio-capture.505/)) and remember yellow is good, green is low volume, and red is bad bad. Check out this [video](https://youtu.be/SVvSwFz2dok) for more details.
 - [ ] Are all files, media files, and related collateral ready for transitions?
 - [ ] Any other sccripts, checklists, or other items available within easy reach?
 
 - [ ] Are all plugins, other apps, or notifications that may break/crash OBS closed?
 - [ ] Are all things that may display personal information, passwords, secrets, and related collateral turned off?
 - [ ] Is audio setup in a way that will work for the stream and post-stream Youtube/etc so that copyright conflicts aren't triggered? re: Check out [Bobby's gist](https://gist.github.com/NotMyself/80de496cb33017708b41a8237cc22d97).
