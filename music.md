# Music for Streaming

There isn't a lot in life that drives me forward and fuels me up like music. Specifically, some pretty heavy stuff along the metal varietals. When streaming it isn't always apparent until Twitch or YouTube decimates your volume and rips out the audio track that you'll notice music isn't free! People do indeed own a legal right to it and you can't just play people's music they create. So here's a few options that will give you good tunes for your video streaming.

... I'm currently researching each of these, so will have more details coming soon ...

## Epidemic Sound

* [https://player.epidemicsound.com](https://player.epidemicsound.com) - The library, specifically for metal, was pretty solid. Not as many different artists as I'd have liked, but overall pretty solid based on what I have seen available so far.

## Pretzel Rocks

* [https://www.pretzel.rocks](https://www.pretzel.rocks) - So far this has been fun, it's wildly easy to set up, but I have had issues getting much beyond a single "metal" album worth of music to play during streams. So far the metal category seems somewhat bleak. I've been tweaking around and searching for ways to get better results but it seems slightly limited so far.
