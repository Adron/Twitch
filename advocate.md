# Market Your Stream

These are listed in an order to ensure they're effective and useful to those prospectively viewing your streams.

1. Schedule your streams ahead of time. Setup that schedule and post the events on Twitch under the _events_ section. Post them via the dashboard events listing [here](https://www.twitch.tv/adronhall/dashboard/events) and view them via the follower interface [here](https://www.twitch.tv/adronhall/events).
2. Blog it, like I attemp to here on my [Thrashing Composite Code Blog](https://compositecode.blog/).
3. [Tweet it](https://twitter.com/). Follow good practice and use appropriate spaces between lines and state specific simple things, with emoji icons per line, with a link to the place the stream will occur. A reasonable example of this is this tweet.
4. Reddit. Post in the [/WatchPeopleCode](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchPeopleCode/) subreddit.
5. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/). Post in the feed. Possibly post in other locations depending on what you're connected with and to whom.
6. [Google+](https://plus.google.com/). I suppose this is ... maybe not worth it but if you've got an account you might as well right?
7. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/). Reluctantly, yes, one ought to post this on Facebook probably.
8. Got an email newsletter or something like [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)? Send out when you schedule an event and the moment you go live (maybe? depending on what your newsletter is for).

*Other Possible Mediums (I'm still researching their efficacy)*

* Sign up for account, possibly another avenue to stream? https://www.liveedu.tv/
* A whole string of sites and such on Product Hunt. https://www.producthunt.com/alternatives/watch-people-code ?? Seems and odd "product" category but late capitalism whatever right?  ;)
* No idea what this is, a medium or a tool? https://asciinema.org/
