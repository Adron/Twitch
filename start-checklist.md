# Startup Checklist

This is a basic checklist of the things I go through before acutally starting any new stream.
| - [ ] | Task |
|---|---|
| - [ ] | Verify that OBS has the appropriate key setup for the stream. |
 - [ ] Are all monitors set to the appropriate resolution.
 - [ ] Are all webcams running and actually set in position and available for transitioning?
 - [ ] Does OBS have the appropriate *sources* setup for the appropriate *scenes* for each respective transition.
 - [ ] Mic check all the mics:
    - [ ] Rode Podcaster http://en.rode.com/microphones/podcaster
    - [ ] Rode Shotgun NTG1 http://en.rode.com/microphones/ntg-1
    - [ ] WebCam Mic(s)
 - [ ] Are all files, media files, and related collateral ready for transitions?
