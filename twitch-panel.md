## Mission

The point of this channel is to create solutions to technical problems with tooling of various sorts; Language Stacks like [Go](https://golang.org/), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)), and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), Databases [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [DataStax Enterprise](https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise), [MS SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx) and other tooling and services like [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). All this, loaded up to some heavy metal tunes, and we'll work together getting through a number of problems and a varied array of solutions.

Along the way I'll also be talking about a whole host of topics, and would love input and opinions, all sorts of opinions, from other aspects of life, getting the solutions done, and all that jazz. As [@Roberttables](https://www.twitch.tv/roberttables) often says, pull a chair up to the virtual table and let's talk!

## Intro to Coding & Databases

Some existing sessions I've done, and will be continuing for some time, are a set of starting to learn Go series. Check out this [curriculum I put together on the upcoming Go sessions](https://compositecode.blog/confs-meetups-events/getting-started-with-go/).

## Metal

I do also have a number of things where I intertwine metal into the twitch session(s). It's what fuels the code, always be ready, it'll come at ya without warning.

## Repositories

I've recently gotten into a more project focused, project organization, build, integration, and flow of projects around various databases and language stacks (started the week of March 4th). I'm working toward a dockerized database back end sample starter development stack for several language stacks including Go, C#/.NET, JavaScript/Node.js, and I'm hoping to add others as I have time. The idea is each of these repos will have identical functionality around a list of databases that I've covered in my "[Bunches of Databases in Bunches of Weeks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4f75Y6Ce5ssKPOFLtPjUmDWsinO4K-c4)" series.

These are the projects I either am working on or working toward something for during the streams. At the beginning of each session I'll describe what I'm going to work on for that session, including the objectives for the specific session.

* [Twitz](https://github.com/Adron/twitz) - Console application for researching Twitter accounts. Written in Go using the Twitter API.
* [Colligere](https://github.com/ThrashingCode/colligere) - Console application written in Go.
* [Data Diluvium](https://github.com/ThrashingCode/datadiluvium) - API written in Go. Currently not working on it, but that'll change in the coming months.
* [InteroperabilityBlackBox](https://github.com/Adron/InteroperabilityBlackBox) - Console application written in C#.
* [terraformed-fields](https://github.com/Adron/terraformed-fields) - Terraform project where I'm putting together a number of resources in Google Cloud Platform for future projects, such as Data Diluvium and a DataStax Enterprise Cassandra Cluster.

## Session Checklist

If you're watching, and would like to take notes, observe, chat, tell me a thing or three, or otherwise get involved please do. Chat is there, as always, but you can dive into the issues on any of the repositories above, submit pull requests or whatever. If you've got an idea let me know, and I'll even work on it or have you on the stream to work on it with me. I'm open to all sorts of hacking on the code so just let me know and we'll make that happen. For each stream, these are the things I'll aim to provide for anybody watching:

1. An objectives list. Usually 2-6 things that I'm going to work toward acheiving in the session. This is usually things like [add logging](https://github.com/Adron/InteroperabilityBlackBox/issues/7), [configuration](https://github.com/Adron/InteroperabilityBlackBox/issues/9), or [add some badges](https://github.com/Adron/InteroperabilityBlackBox/issues/11).
2. A wrap up blog entry for the topic specific sessions. I'm going to start (since I haven't done this for all previous sessions) doing this and posting it on [Composite Thrashing Code](https://compositecode.blog/). The post will then reference the videos I've streamed and archived on my [Thrashing Code Youtube Channel (subscribe there to get new videos when posted)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHSCXYCMOOS-VSUdRsn13GQ). For the general stream sessions where I'm just working through non-specifically detailed or topical things, i.e. mostly chatting and working on some random things, those will just go straight to archive on YouTube.
3. A basic timeline of the video. Again, something I haven't done traditionally, but have started doing. I'll provide this for each video in the description of the video where I archive it on Youtube and also on the blog entry I post of the video, which of course is over yonder on the [Thrashing Code Youtube Channel (subscribe there to get new videos when posted)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHSCXYCMOOS-VSUdRsn13GQ).

I've also started a video streaming repo of my gear, process, and related video streaming details. Check that out at [VidStreamHacking](https://github.com/Adron/VidStreamHacking).
