# Twitch Streaming Patterns & Practices
I set up a repository on Github that has many of these details in addition to others here.  This document focuses solely on why prioritize Twitch and how to go about doing that.

## Why?

Twitch has a gamified ranking system when one sets up an account. When one streams from the account more, gets more followers, interacts with those followers, and otherwise adds value via their stream to the Twitch platform they get more rights within the system. The rights expand to give more and different ways to interact with these users, provide additional content via streams and uploaded videos, and increased permissions and at some point to even gain revenue from these interactions and related activities on the stream.

## The Catch!

The catch to all of this increased activity is legally there is a clause that no content streamed on Twitch will be shown or made available anywhere else for 24 hours. As a company entity, a small legality we should follow.

## It’s Easy!

Even though there is this caveat, it’s easy to stream on Twitch and then upload for VOD (Video On Demand) afterwards through features in the Twitch dashboard. We will need to simply connect the Twitch account to the YouTube account via the oauth that they’ve provided and this upload feature will be a default capability.
